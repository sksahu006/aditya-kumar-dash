        <p className="text-xl">
          I began my journey in graphic design with classwork, where I learned the fundamentals of design, including color theory, typography, and software tools like Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. This phase helped me build a strong foundation and develop an eye for aesthetics. Through multiple assignments and projects, I explored different styles and techniques, gradually improving my skills.
